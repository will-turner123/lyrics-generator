have you realised that rock stars
always seem to lie so much?
john lydon once said he cared
but he never really gave a fuck
said he'd use the money he made
so that people would have somewhere to go
but now he lives in the usa
and snorts coke after the show
why is it that rock stars
always seem to lie so much?
joe strummer once said he cared
but he never really gave a fuck
said he'd use the money he made
to set up a radio station
to make the airwaves full of something more than shit
have you noticed we're still waiting?
you must realise that rock stars
always seem to lie so much
some will always tell you that they care
but they don't really give a fuck
still you suckers don't ever learn
that rock stars deal in money not truth
it's good business to exploit you
just look at lydon or strummer for proof
of all the torment i've been through
i never knew hell till i met you
your imperious aura, your needs understood
you wouldn't tell me the truth if you could
but in the back room, a garden of delight
cut through the bar just like a fist fight
for a moment i thought i saw something in your eyes
that's when i was taken by surprise
soul of washrag, show no sadness
face of poker, show no fears
overwhelming, you show no mercy
mediocre, show no tears
now this party's crazy, i gotta go
but before i leave, i gotta know
that night in the room full of violent screams
when you whispered me your secret dreams
as we both laid there on the floor
you said it takes two to start a war
for a moment i thought i saw something in your eyes
that's when i was taken by surprise
soul of washrag, show no sadness
face of poker, show no fears
overwhelming, you show no mercy
mediocre, show no tears
for a moment i thought i saw something in your eyes
that's when i was taken by surprise
soul of washrag, show no sadness
face of poker, show no fears
overwhelming, you show no mercy
mediocre, show no tears

the system might have got you but it won't get me
1 - 2 - 3 - 4
external control are you gonna let them get you?
do you wanna be a prisoner in the boundaries they set you?
you say you want to be yourself, by christ do you think they'll let you?
they're out to get you get you get you get you get you get you get you
hello, hello, hello, this is the lord god, can you hear?
hellfire and damnation's what i've got for you down there
on earth i have ambassadors, archbishop, vicar, pope
we'll blind you with morality, you'd best abandon any hope
we're telling you you'd better pray 'cause you were born in sin
right from the start we'll build a cell and then we'll lock you in
we sit in holy judgement condemning those that stray
we offer our forgiveness, but first we'll make you pay
external control are you gonna let them get you?
do you wanna be a prisoner in the boundaries they set you?
you say you want to be yourself, by christ do you think they'll let you?
they're out to get you get you get you get you get you get you get you
hello, hello, hello, now here's a massage from your queen
as figurehead of the status quo i set the social scene
i'm most concerned about my people, i want to give them peace
so i'm making sure they stay in line with my army and police
my prisons and my mental homes have ever open doors
for those amongst my subjects who dare to ask for more
unruliness and disrespect are things i can't allow
so i'll see the peasants grovel if they refuse to bow
external control are you gonna let them get you?
do you wanna be a prisoner in the boundaries they set you?
you say you want to be yourself, by christ do you think they'll let you?
they're out to get you get you get you get you get you get you get you
introducing the prime sinister, she's a mother to us all
like the dutch boy's finger in the dyke her arse is in the wall
holding back the future waiting for the seas to part
if moses did it with is faith, she'll do it with an army
who at times of threatened crisis are certain to be there
guarding national heritage no matter what or where
palaces for kings and queens, mansions for the rich
protection for the wealthy, defence of privilege
they've learnt the ropes in ireland, engaged in civil war
fighting for the ruling classes in their battle against the poor
so ireland's just an island? it's an island of the mind
great britain? future? bollocks, you'd better look behind
round every other corner stands p.c. 1984
guardian of the future, he'll implement the law
he's there as a grim reminder that no matter what you do
big brothers system's always there with his beady eyes on you
from god to local bobby, in home and street and school
they've got your name and number while you've just got their rule
we've got to look for methods to undermine those powers
it's time to change the tables. the future must be ours
big a, little a, bouncing b
the system might have got you but it won't get me
be exactly who you want to be, do what you want to do
i am he and she is she but you're the only you
no one else has got your eyes, can see the things you see
it's up to you to change your life and my life's up to me
the problems that you suffer from are problems that you make
the shit we have to climb through is the shit we choose to take
if you don't like the life you live, change it now it's yours
nothing has effects if you don't recognise the cause
if the programme's not the one you want, get up, turn off the set
it's only you that can decide what life you're gonna get
if you don't like religion you can be the antichrist
if your tired of politics you can be an anarchist
but no one ever changed the church by pulling down a steeple
and you'll never change the system by bombing number ten
systems just aren't made of bricks they're mostly made of people
you may send them into hiding, but they'll be back again
if you don't like the rules they make, refuse to play their game
if you don't want to be a number, don't give them your name
if you don't want to be caught out, refuse to hear their question
silence is a virtue, use it for your own protection
they'll try to make you play their game, refuse to show your face
if you don't want to be beaten down, refuse to join their race
be exactly who you want to be, do what you want to do
i am he and she is she but you're they only you
i hate my school
my teachers insane
the kids are all fools
and the world’s down the drain
why don’t you all leave me alone?
all i wanna do is go home
why don’t you all leave me alone?
all i wanna do is go home
feedin' my brain
i feel like i been hit
i can’t take the strain
so maybe i’ll quit
why don’t you all leave me alone?
all i wanna do is go home
why don’t you all leave me alone?
all i wanna do is go home
why don’t you all leave me alone?
all i wanna do is go home
why don’t you all leave me alone?
all i wanna do is go home
people try to tell me
what they think is right for me
think there's some value
to what they got to say
but i won't listen to them
i don't need their advice
i wouldn't ever have it
any other fucking way
 x4
can't tell no one
what to do

rules are made for idiots
people that can't think
i'm treated like i don't
have a mind of my own
stupid fucking idiots
with stupid fucking ideals
when will they ever
fucking leave me alone
 x4

 x41
one - two - three - go
i've got an ego
it won't let me go
what am i gonna do?
a - b - c - d
paranoia's killing me
i'm dying on my aching feet
what a way to go
roll up - roll up
people always stroll up
say "why don't you grow up?"
no thank you!
big cats, small cats
some cats are fat cats
those cats are bad cats
what we gonna do?
there's an awful lot of people in the world today
there's an awful lot of trouble in the streets these days
and it doesn't seem to matter what you do or say
if a change is gonna come you've got to help it on its way
a change is gonna come before too long i know
peace has gotta come, well, i could be wrong i know
but i just don't know what i can do
you don't trust me and i don't trust you
i bet you wish you did and i know i do
why have you got secrets? cause i know you have
if you've got something to hide then it must be bad
a change is gonna come before too long i know
peace has gotta come, well, i could be wrong i know
but i just don't know what i can do
you don't trust me and i don't trust you
i bet you wish you did and i know i do
why have you got secrets? cause i know you have
if you've got something to hide then it must be bad
a change is gonna come before too long i know
peace has gotta come, well, i could be wrong i know
but i just don't know what i can do1
kill a commie, kill a commie
i don't wanna die!
kill a commie, kill a commie
i don't wanna go to war!
kill a commie, kill a commie

that's all i wanna do!
kill a commie, kill a commie
i don't wanna die!
kill a commie, kill a commie

that's all we have to do!
it's all acquiring as many things as you can
and the more you get the less of a man
you become to all who stay around you
people are just dollars to you anymore
you think money - equals importance
you think money - measures success
you think money - validates your calloused conscience
your money doesn't mean a thing to me
what's it like to never relax
what's it like to fear an attack
by your 'friends' who think that you lack the new thing
that will make your life complete
all the people you've stepped upon
to look out across your big green lawn
to see your shiny new black car
you hear their screams
they're not very far away
